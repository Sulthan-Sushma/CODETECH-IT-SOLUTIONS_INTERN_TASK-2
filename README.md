Duration: December 2024 – January 2025
Mentor: Neela Santhosh Kumar

Goal
Develop a weather application where users can:

1.Search for the current weather of any city or location.
2.View detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
3.Toggle between metric and imperial units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).

Technologies Used:

1.React.js: For building a dynamic, component-based UI.
2.JavaScript (ES6): To implement functionality.
3.CSS: For styling and enhancing user experience.
4.OpenWeatherMap API: To fetch real-time weather data.

Critical Functionalities

1.Search Weather: Users can input a city name to view its weather details.
2.Dynamic Weather Data: Fetch and display real-time weather updates using API integration.
3.Unit Conversion: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units with a toggle button.
4.Error Handling: Notify users when an invalid city name is entered.

Components
1.WeatherApp: Main component managing state and API requests.
2.SearchBar: Input field and button for location-based searches.
3.WeatherDetails: Displays weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
4.UnitToggle: Button to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

State Management
React’s useState Hook:

-->Manages the current weather data and search queries.
-->Tracks the selected unit of measurement.

Event Handling
Event listeners for:
 -->Form submission to initiate a weather search.
 -->Button clicks for toggling units.
 -->Error handling for invalid inputs.
 
Learning Outcomes

1.Understanding API integration and fetching data dynamically.
2.Managing state effectively using React hooks.
3.Implementing conditional rendering for responsive design.
4.Enhancing UI/UX using CSS and real-time feedback.

Possible Extensions

1.Forecast Feature: Display a 5-day weather forecast.
2.Geolocation: Auto-detect and display the weather of the user’s current location.
3.Local Storage: Save the last searched location for a seamless user experience.
4.Animations: Add weather-themed animations (e.g., raindrops, clouds).
5.Theming: Support dark and light modes for better usability.
